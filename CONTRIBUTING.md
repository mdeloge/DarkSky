This is a little side project for my postgraduate program where we are doing a lot of energy based analyses that require weather data for calculating heating degree days, building energy losses, etc.
Any contribution is welcome as long as it contributes to the overall theme of this project: gathering and preprocessing weather data to support big data analyses.
All suggestions are welcome, as this is a little project.
